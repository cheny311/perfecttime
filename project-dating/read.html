            <h1>Dating Game Wedding Photo Booth</h1>
            
            <p class="indent-1">My inspiration came from my experiences using dating apps in New York City. I often feel that people are constantly trying to make themselves more attractive by adjusting or reshaping who they are.</p>
            
            <p class="indent-2">Communication in these spaces can feel performative, filled with gestures, timing, and impressions rather than genuine understanding. This project reflects that pressure, as well as the uncertainty, fantasy, and emotional distance.</p>
            
            <p class="indent-3">In the first scene, players are asked to match a target color by adjusting RGB values... the act of “tuning” these values mirrors how people selectively present parts of themselves.</p>
            
            <p class="indent-1">When interacting with others, there is only a 10% chance that the player will “get along.” This outcome is purely based on chance, reflecting the randomness of dating apps.</p>
            
            <p class="indent-2">After that, the player enters a movie-like scene where the task is to hold hands. This interaction represents the ambiguity of emotional distance and the constant negotiation of closeness.</p>
            
            <p class="indent-3">Once hands are held, the player moves on to a kissing interaction. Everything is about timing—you must click at the right moment. If the kiss is approved, the relationship progresses to a wedding photo.</p>
            
            <p class="indent-1">In the wedding scene, you can upload an image or use your webcam. I designed multiple templates inspired by wedding photography as a form of subcultural expression.</p>
            
            <p class="indent-2">This scene reflects my tendency to develop emotional attachments quickly. After completing the photo, you can take the train home, where people begin swiping once again, returning to the cycle.</p>
