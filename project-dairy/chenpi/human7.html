        You are now sixteen years old and it’s a scorching summer day. You’re wearing a tank top and
        decide to call a car because it’s too hot to walk home. As you sit in the car, you start to
        feel uncomfortable and notice someone watching you. You begin to look around, trying to
        find the source of the gaze. Finally, as you glance in the rearview mirror, you see the
        driver staring intently at your exposed chest. How would you respond to such a gaze?
      </h2>

            Put on my earphones, avoid eye contact, and cover myself with my backpack. Then I start
            to hate the summer and wonder: “Did I see it wrong? Am I being too sensitive?” I feel
            disgusted and think: “Summer is just so annoying.”

            I would yell: “What are you looking at? Haven’t you seen a chest before?” or “I knew a
            pervert like you would stare at my chest! Pull over!” Then I would scold him, make him
            get out of the car, and slap him.
