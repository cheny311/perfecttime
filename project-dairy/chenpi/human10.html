      <h2>
        Now you are 20 years old. You take the subway home at 9 o’clock as usual. You are waiting for
        the train with your friend on the platform when a man walks over and asks you for the time.
        You show him the time on your phone screen. Later, your friend leaves and you board the
        train. The man sits to your left and gets closer and closer until you can feel the heat of
        his breath. He talks to you and asks you many questions, but you don’t want to answer any of
        them. How should you respond?
